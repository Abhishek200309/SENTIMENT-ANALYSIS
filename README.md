# Description

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on textual data such as tweets and reviews. The goal is to classify each text into two categories — Positive or Negative — using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning techniques.

The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow in NLP:

  - Text data preprocessing and cleaning

  - Tokenization and sequence padding

  - Model building using Bidirectional LSTM

  - Model training and evaluation

  - WordCloud visualization of sentiments

  - Real-time prediction through a Streamlit web app

By following this process, we gain practical experience in text preprocessing, sequence modeling, and sentiment classification — key skills in real-world NLP applications.

# Workflow Explanation

1. Data Loading

The dataset (Twitter Sentiment Dataset) contains labeled tweets categorized into four classes: Positive, Negative, Neutral, and Irrelevant.
It is loaded using Pandas for preprocessing and analysis.
